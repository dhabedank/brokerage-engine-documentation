The language of real estate is diverse and wide-ranging. Understanding the terms we use in Brokerage Engine is key to effectively navigating your way through the platform. In this article, we provide definitions and additional context to the fields, functionalities and features contained within the platform.

## General
Brokerage Engine is a modular platform, but there are some common features that interplay with listings, tasks, marketing and documents. Below we discuss those in more detail.

### Dashboard
The Dashboard provides users with updates and quick access to Brokerage Engine data through a collection of pre-defined widgets. This is not to be confused with the [Transactions dashboard](./transactions/transactions-dashboard.md), which is only accessible by `Accounting` users.

:::note
Dashboard widgets are fixed, and **cannot** be modified on a per-customer basis.

#### Quick Launch Dashboard Widget
Displays all new listings in <Highlight color="#E57373">DRAFT</Highlight> status, where a user has **also** completed the Coming Soon - Listing Announcement task. When the listing moves to <Highlight color="#16D39A">ACTIVE</Highlight> it will be automatically removed from the Coming Soon dashboard widget.

#### Buyer Needs Dashboard Widget
Users may add buyer needs to the company dashboard, and also broadcast that buyer need to agents in selected offices. By clicking <Highlight color="#00B5B8">**+** Add Buyer Needs</Highlight>, the user is prompted to enter the following fields.
- `Location`
- `Budget`
- `Comments`
- `Who Should Know?`
  - Tagging offices in this section will notify all agents in that office by email of the new buyer need.
- `Contact Agent` **(staff only)**
  - When a staff member is adding the buyer need on behalf of an agent, they must designate who that agent is.

:::tip
Upon customer request, Brokerage Engine can enable a 30, 60 or 90 day auto-cleanup routine for Buyer Needs.

:::

:::note
Although Brokerage Engine can be configured to have Automatic Payments enabled by default on agent profiles, an agent **may** chose to disable Automatic Payments at their own discretion.

## Training Videos
For your convenience and benefit, instructional videos have been included in-app to better explain common uses of Brokerage Engine. Videos are segmented by the user's permissions, so `Agent` users will only see videos pertaining to them. `Admin` users will see videos intended for staff **and** agents.

## Logout
For security purposes, it is recommended to logout of Brokerage Engine if the application was used on a public computer.

### Exit Impersonation
When an `Admin` is impersonating an `Agent` profile, exiting the impersonation will return the user back to their `Admin` account. The user may now proceed logging out of Brokerage Engine.
