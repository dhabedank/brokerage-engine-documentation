Brokerage Engine integrates with Realogy's dashAPI interface to provide companies with bidirectional data synchronization of personnel information, listings, pending contracts and closed transactions between Brokerage Engine and DASH. Paired with integration to your MLS, our platform effectively provides a single point of entry method for listing input and updates. As part of your onboarding, the Implementation Team will assist with Realogy's dashAPI User Acceptance Testing (UAT) process. The UAT process is essential for validating the data exchange between Brokerage Engine and Realogy, ensuring your records are transmitted accurately.

The following information identifies the onboarding steps.

1. **dashAPI Onboarding Request**
   - Brokerage Engine will initiate the dashAPI onboarding request email to Realogy, informing them that your company's interest in using dashAPI to transmit data to DASH.
2. **Broker Confirmation**
   - Realogy will send an introductory email to the brokerage confirming that they would like to proceed with dashAPI onboarding. As part of this process, Realogy will provide access to the dashAPI Onboarding Tool (DOT) which will allow you to see the settings enabled for Brokerage Engine to transmit data for your company.
     - Please use your DASH login credentials to access the dashAPI portal (the same as your brand login; i.e. firstname.lastname@brand.com).
     - You may designate the person(s) in your company that will review and sign-off on the information transmitted by Brokerage Engine to the dashAPI onboarding environment.
     - You may request changes to the information that Brokerage Engine is allowed to transmit to DASH.
3. **UAT Start**
   - Brokerage Engine begins processing the Customer's records and transmits those results to Realogy for approval.
4. **Client Review**
   - Once Brokerage Engine finished processing all customer records, the Customer will need to review and provide their approval.
        1. Pick a listing, personnel and transaction record.
        2. Open the production DASH environment (i.e. https://dash.brandname.com) and the UAT environment (i.e. https://ven.dash.brandname.com) in separate browser windows.
        3. Do a quick review of the listing / personnel / transaction and make sure all data fields are matching between Production and UAT.
        4. If UAT and Production data is a match, we consider the data to be validated.
5. **Client Acceptance and Scheduling Go-Live**
   - After confirming UAT data is valid, the Customer should provide confirmation to Realogy.
     - "The transmitted records meet our business requirements. I hereby formally sign off on the results. Please proceed with launch scheduling."
   - Realogy will provide their earliest available dates for the Customer to activate dashAPI on Brokerage Engine.
6. **Go-Live**
   - On the evening of the scheduled Go-Live date, Realogy will activate the dashAPI for Brokerage Engine and provide confirmation the next morning.
   - Upon receiving notification from Realogy of a successful Go-Live, Brokerage Engine will load all listings / personnel / transaction records to a Customer's account.
7. **Success!**
   - The Customer is now live on Brokerage Engine with dashAPI support.
