## Faster to Market. Faster to Sell.
It’s Friday evening and the clients just agreed to a price reduction. Great! But why wait for Monday to have it updated by the broker on all of your syndicated websites like Trulia, Zillow, Homes.com and dozens of others? You’re now in control. Brokerage Engine allows you to make the price change in seconds. It doesn’t end there, however - you’ll have total access to change prices, expiration dates, remarks and so much more.
