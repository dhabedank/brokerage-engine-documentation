With powerful document compliance features, brokerage staff can easily manage the flow of listing and transaction documents and ensure our details are accurate. From acquiring signatures on contracts from clients, to confirming that all transaction documents are up to date, our seamless Document Management module keeps all your key information in one place.

### Activity Logs
Provide complete insight into whenever documents are uploaded and approved or rejected â€“ by who and when.

### No more duplicate entries!
Document lists are fully integrated with your existing listings, transactions and agents.

### Intelligent Checklists
Dynamically generate checklist requirements for listings and transactions based on conditional data points like geographic location (ex. specific county disclosures) or age (ex. lead based paint disclosure).

### And so much more!
- Upload and split large PDF files into individual checklist items.
- Quick Audit allows staff members to quickly go through all brokerage listing/transaction/agent documents needing approval in one interface, rather than needing to enter each file.
- Allow agents to send documents directly into the system via email.
