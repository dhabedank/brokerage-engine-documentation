How many times have you been asked when the next issue of a local magazine runs or how much a brochure costs? Perhaps, as a brokerage marketer, you never seem to get quite the right information on a request. And have we mentioned the accounting spreadsheets? Those are the worst. The Marketing Opportunities Catalog in Brokerage Engine is designed to streamline the way you offer marketing, services and swag to the brokerage. Equal parts educational and functional, agents can learn about opportunities, order and pay - leaving marketers with more time to do what they love.
